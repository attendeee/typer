                "Once upon a time, long long ago, there was a little blue gopher. Our little blue friend wanted to go on an adventure, but he wasn't sure where to go. Will you go on an adventure with him?",
                "One of his friends once recommended going to New York to make friends at this mysterious thing called \"GothamGo\". It is supposed to be a big event with free swag and if there is one thing gophers love it is free trinkets. Unfortunately, the gopher once heard a campfire story about some bad fellas named the Sticky Bandits who also live in New York. In the stories these guys would rob toy stores and terrorize young boys, and it sounded pretty scary.",
                "On the other hand, he has always heard great things about Denver. Great ski slopes, a bad hockey team with cheap tickets, and he even heard they have a conference exclusively for gophers like himself. Maybe Denver would be a safer place to visit.",
                "You arrive in Denver and start your trip by attending a hockey game. The Avalanche had a rough season last year, but your gopher buddy is hopeful that they will do better this year. He also explains that he is tired of hearing about \"Two time Stanley Cup champion Phil Kessel.\" You suspect that he is still a little salty about the Penguins beating the San Jose Sharks in the Stanley Cup, but you decide to give him a break.",
                "The next day you head to the slopes and blaze a few trails. You can definitely see why Denver is called the \"Mile-High City\". Gorgeous mountain scenery doesn't come close to describing it.",
                "You consider checking out this GopherCon you have heard so much about, but a quick check on their website has your gopher buddy vetoing it. It turns out he has a strict, \"No Space Walks\" policy, and refuses to believe that it is just a graphic on the website.",
                "The week quickly flies by and before you know it you are packing up to head home.",
                "Your little gopher buddy thanks you for taking him on an adventure. Perhaps next year you can look into travelling abroad - you have both heard that gophers are all the rage in China."
